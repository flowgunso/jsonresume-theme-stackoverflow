# Stack Overflow theme for [moshe742/resume-json-python](https://github.com/moshe742/resume-json-python)

This is a port of [phoinixi/jsonresume-theme-stackoverflow](https://github.com/phoinixi/jsonresume-theme-stackoverflow) to the [Jinja2 template engine](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/) and therefore to Python.

This theme is supposed to work with [moshe742/resume-json-python](https://github.com/moshe742/resume-json-python) which is a port of [resume-cli](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli) to Python.
